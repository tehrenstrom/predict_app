Unless otherwise agreed, the sales tracing and chargeback report must be received\nby Coloplast weekly via EDI. If Authorized Reseller does not have EDI capabilities, Authorized Reseller will use best efforts to obtain EDI capabilities within six (6) months from notification of approval and send sales tracings and chargeback requests via Excel\nfile in the EDI-867 and/or EDI-844 format during this timeframe. Sales tracings and/or chargeback not supplied by the required timeframe may result in all corresponding chargebacks being denied.
